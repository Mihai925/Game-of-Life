			<h2>Know the rules first!</h2>
			
			<p>Being a zero-player game, you just need to provide an initial configuration to the board. From that point onwards, the A.I. will take control and apply certain rules.</p><br />
			<p>The game consists of a 30x30 circular grid. You can create a red cell by left-clicking, a green one by right-clicking or you can kill a cell by clicking the middle mouse button. After you have designed an initial configuration, you can either click Run or Step. At this point, the cells will begin to reproduce or die depending on the following rules:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies, by isolation</li>
				<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation</li>
				<li>Any live cell with three or more live neighbours dies by over-crowding</li>
				<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, by reproduction. The color of the new live cell will be that of the majority of its neighbours. </li>
			</ol>
